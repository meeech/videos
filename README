tested with php >= 5.2 , mysql, httpd, HandBrake-cli

About
-----

Based off Videos5 ( http://code.google.com/p/videos5/ ). 
I liked the idea, but wasn't crazy about the implementation, and could use the practice.
So, there you have it.

* Everything is set to default .mp4 - Will see if we need to broaden that.

* logs folder - should be readable/writeable for the webapp.
    * * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/videos5/encode.php >> /var/www/videos5/logs/encoding.log 2>&1

php php-mbstring mysql php-mysql mplayer HandBrake-cli mediainfo httpd


Installation
------------

1. Create a empty MySQL database, and a user that can read & write in it.

2. Import schema-mysql.sql into your new database.

3. Configure the path(s) where your videos are stored in the settings table.
   Edit the row where name = 'paths'; one path per line, i.e. line-feed (\n) 
   separated values.

4. In your httpd (Apache or other) configuration, make sure .mp4 and .mov 
   files are served with the correct content-type:
   For example, you could all those to the VirtualHost section of your 
   httpd.conf (or httpd.d/xxx.conf) file:

	AddType video/mp4 .mp4
	AddType video/quicktime .mov

5. Add crontab entries to encode and scan your videos folders.
   Make sure to use the correct path to Videos5 index.php, and redirect the 
   output into log files that httpd can write into.
   Also make sure that the user running the 'encode' crontab has write access 
   to your videos folders, since this is where the newly encoded files will be
   saved.

	* * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/videos5/index.php encode >> /var/www/videos5/logs/encode.log 2>&1
	0 4 * * * /bin/nice /usr/bin/php /var/www/videos5/index.php find > /var/www/videos5/logs/found_movies.log 2>&1

6. Manually launch a scan of your videos folder:

	/usr/bin/php /var/www/videos5/index.php find

Once that command completes, you should be able to browse your videos using 
the web interface, stream compatible videos in your browser, and queue 
incompatible videos for encoding.

The default PIN for protected user profiles is "1234".


Customizing Videos5
-------------------

You can customize some setting that Videos5 uses in the web interface or to 
encode videos.
Look in the settings table in your videos5 database.

'paths': Where Videos5 will look for videos to display in the web interface.
         One path per line, i.e. line-feed (\n) separated values.

'encode_command': The command used to encode videos. Make sure to use 
                  $input and $output for the filenames to use as input and 
                  output.
                  The default encode_command should produce videos compatible 
                  with all Apple mobile devices, and webkit-based browsers.

'encode_extension': The file extension used for newly encoded files.

'video_extensions': The file extensions that Videos5 will look for in your 
                    videos folders to find video files.

'ignored_devices': If present, this setting will identify all the devices that
                   you don't care about. Files not compatible with those 
                   devices, but compatible with all others, will not have 
                   an 'Encode' option in the UI; only Play will be available.
                   Coma-separated value.
